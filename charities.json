For 26 years, IRF has funded and operated rhino conservation programs in Africa and Asia, focusing expertise and resources in areas where rhinos are most in need of protection, and where conservation efforts will do the most good. At the heart of IRF's vision is the belief that these magnificent species should endure for future generations, and that protecting rhinos ensures the survival of many other species, including people. Since its founding, IRF has also provided funding for scientific research that enhances the ability to manage rhinoceros populations both in the wild. IRF has awarded nearly $700,000 to applied rhino research in the past 10 years, and is the only source of funding exclusively devoted to rhinoceros."

Additionally, IEAS educates the public through school programs, tour lectures, support for conservation programs, and public appearances about the value and worth of these sensitive, intelligent and perceptive animals, so that their future, as an important part of our world, is insured. We are committed to strengthening and promoting conservation education and other avenues to foster conservation in which we can participate. Our major goal is to give the resident animals the best quality of life we can give them in captivity through our Emotional Enrichment Program, which deals with the emotional well-being of each individual animal and its individual emotional needs."

We promote legislation that protects the boundaries between religion and government, so that politics doesn't infringe on your faith and matters of faith don't infringe on your freedom. Our local affiliates mobilize individuals on the grass-roots level to make a difference in their own communities. We offer a forum to challenge bigotry and defend religious freedom on local issues, including candidate education, religion in the public sphere, and interfaith relations. We help religious leaders and politicians navigate the boundary between politics and religion in a way that safeguards the separation of church and state. We facilitate interfaith dialogue to enhance mutual understanding and respect for religious differences."

The Institute for Policy Studies is the counterweight to the dealmakers. We work to reclaim democracy. We collaborate with grassroots movements to foster the conditions for long-term change. We promote relationships, linking activists and public officials who share our belief that a better world is possible. We launch, inform and sustain democratic movements. The Institute's work is organized into over a dozen projects, reflecting our public scholars' diverse areas of expertise. In practice, they make crucial linkages across the movements for peace, justice and the environment."

IJ provides legal counsel to inner-city entrepreneurs, because their freedom to shape their own businesses directly affects their freedom to shape their own lives and communities. In addition, IJ trains law students, lawyers, policy activists and grassroots organizers in the tactics of public interest litigation and advocacy for liberty. Through these activities, IJ challenges the ideology of the welfare state and illustrates and extends the benefits of freedom to those whose full enjoyment of liberty is denied by government."

Ten sisters were sent to California in 1871. A climate of renewal, called for by the second Vatican Council, brought about a break from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in 1970 and opened membership to men and women, single or married, from all Christian denominations. Members come from many fields including education, social work, law, parish ministry, the arts, health care, and administration of public and non-profit organizations."

The Iditarod covers over 1,150 miles of terrain, and the Sled Dog Race has been called the \"Last Great Race on Earth,\" winning worldwide acclaim and interest. The race pits man and animal against nature, against wild Alaska at her best and as each mile is covered, a tribute to Alaska's past is issued. The Iditarod is a tie to - a commemoration of - that colorful past."

The majority are working poor, many are elderly on fixed incomes (some raising grandchildren), and some are disabled mentally and/or physically. Some are veterans. Nobody is turned away who needs help. ICM began 34 years ago as an interfaith collaboration among local Christian and Jewish congregations, and has expanded to include many supporters of civic organizations, schools, and corporate employee groups, foundations and corporations."

Their idea, using funds raised from private sources to invest in the work of promising young cancer researchers, resulted in the Seed Grant Program, which has helped the JCCC break new ground in the quest to defeat cancer. Although seed grants remain an important part of JCCF's mission, the Foundation today also supports numerous high-priority, multi-disciplinary cancer research efforts focused on rapidly translating discoveries made in the laboratory into improved screening, treatment and prevention."

The Foundation started its work through the localized efforts of the Philadelphia Soul Arena Football Team and its celebrity owners (which included Jon Bon Jovi). The Foundation quickly expanded its work to have a national presence in it's commitment to develop role models for our city on the individual level, corporate level, and community level by developing, promoting, and assisting in innovative and long-lasting solutions to rebuilding pride in one's self and one's community â€“ one SOUL at a time."

To accomplish this goal, Jamestown employs very intricate strategies. First, we use well-researched youth development theory and practice as the underlying framework for program design, implementation, and evaluation. This approach emphasizes young people's resiliency in the face of challenges and recognizes their natural urge to grow up to be successful adults. Second, we offer youth the opportunity to participate in Jamestown year after year, from age 0 to 18. To deepen their engagement, youth are encouraged to join more than one Jamestown program. Ultimately, we hope to watch these youth graduate from both high school and from Jamestown."

This means that parents, family members, business partners and other community members fund the education our children receive at Bacich and Kent. Nearly half of the California school districts have created foundations to provide additional funding for their schools and our district is no exception in this area. In fact, your support and other community members' generosity provides nearly a tenth of our district's budget dollars."
